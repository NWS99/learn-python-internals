# learn-python-internals

This Repo will be used to learn and test the python language internals.
I'll try to implement some python specific features as well as some basic coding practices.

This Repo will be partially based on available learning material including book, videos, tutorials, ...
I will always try not to blindly copy the given implementation example, but to come up with an own idea or implementation.

Maybe this repo will be useful from someone else on their way of learning python.
